Hello, Welcome to my readme. My name is Sean and I have had experience working with C++, git, linux and a few other softwares and languages. I am here to learn more about Java and Possibly make some cool AI systems with it and get into high frequency trading because I love to trade options and would love to experience that field from a mix of two passions. 

Languages:
C++ | Java | Linux Scripting

Softwares:
Intellj | Xcode | MATLAB | Simulink

I am always looking to work on a project with people so feel free to reach out on discord @ seano all lowercase and I would get back to you extreamly fast.
